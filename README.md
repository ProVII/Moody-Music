# Welcome to Moody Music
This readme file provides you with any instructions necessary to run this application and makes it easier to understand.

### Running the application
You can test the application live from: http://moodymusic.mybluemix.net
This application is very simple to use, once published, all you really need to do is to login (and accept permissions) to facebook and/or twitter and it will automatically start retrieving your status/tweet updates and you'll enjoy music.

Unfortunately, this is not the case right now since the application is not published. Anyone who'd like to use this application, would've to be pre-authorized within the app's facebook/twitter page. Therefore, you've 3 options from here:
  Contact us with a link to your facebook page, and we'll approve you on the app's page as a tester, which will send a notification for you to accept. Now you're able to test the app with facebook, but not twitter (there's no login functionality implemented for twitter yet).
  Any twitter/facebook status update goes through the Moody Dictionary algorithm, therefore, you can edit the script within the index page body, and simply add a hardcoded custom call to that algorithm with any quote you wanna try
